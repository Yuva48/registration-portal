🔧 RENDER PHP DEPLOYMENT FIX
============================

The error "php: command not found" means Render needs to be configured for PHP properly.

🔄 SOLUTION - Update Your Render Service:

1. GO TO YOUR RENDER DASHBOARD
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Settings"

2. UPDATE ENVIRONMENT:
   - Environment: PHP (make sure this is selected)
   - Runtime: PHP 8.1 or higher

3. UPDATE BUILD/START COMMANDS:
   
   Build Command:
   composer install --no-dev && mkdir -p data uploads && chmod 755 data uploads
   
   Start Command:
   php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT index.php

4. ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - Add variable: PORT = 10000
   - Add variable: APP_ENV = production

5. REDEPLOY:
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Go to "Manual Deploy"
   - Click "Deploy latest commit"

🎯 ALTERNATIVE - Try These Simpler Commands:

Build Command:
mkdir -p data uploads

Start Command:
php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT index.php

📝 IMPORTANT:
- Make sure "Environment" is set to "PHP" in service settings
- Use $PORT instead of 10000 in start command
- If still failing, try selecting "Docker" environment and I'll create a Dockerfile

💡 If PHP environment doesn't work, we can switch to Railway.app or create a Docker deployment.
