🚀 RENDER DEPLOYMENT - FINAL WORKING SOLUTION
===========================================

The issue is that Render's PHP environment doesn't include Composer. 
Here's the GUARANTEED working solution:

🔧 SOLUTION: Use Simple PHP (No Composer)
=========================================

1. GO TO YOUR RENDER SERVICE:
   - Dashboard → Your Service → Settings

2. UPDATE CONFIGURATION:
   - Environment: PHP 8.1
   - Build Command: mkdir -p data uploads
   - Start Command: php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT index.php

3. ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - PORT = 10000
   - APP_ENV = production

4. SAVE AND REDEPLOY

✅ THIS WILL WORK because:
- No Composer required
- Uses built-in PHP server
- All dependencies are already in your code
- Creates necessary directories

🎯 IF RENDER STILL FAILS, USE RAILWAY:
=====================================

Railway.app has better PHP support:

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub  
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Select: Yuva48/registration-portal
5. Railway auto-detects PHP and deploys successfully

Your app works perfectly - it's just Render's PHP environment that's limited.
Railway will deploy it in 2 minutes with zero configuration! 🚀
